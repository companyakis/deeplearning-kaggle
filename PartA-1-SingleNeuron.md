 # Linear Unit
 A neuron (or unit) with one input looks like:

x: input, 
w: x's connection to the neuron has a weight
b: bias

The neural unit y = w * x + b

* A neural network "learns" by modifying its weights.
* The bias enables the neuron to modify the output independently of its inputs.

# Multiple Inputs
A linear unit (neuron) with three inputs looks like:

y = w0 * x0 + w1 * x1 + w2 * x2 + b
